                <p>My interest in programming began a couple years ago. I had always been interested in tech from a consumer standpoint, specifically the hardware side
                    as I have built computers in the past. Within the last year I realized it would be wise to make the jump into a new industry and with th help
                    of some close friends already working in software engineering I have enrolled in the Flatiron School.

                    <p>If you haven't already noticed, in the sidebar I have linked my birdwatching-specific Instagram account. For the last 2 and a half years
                        I have been learning about, studying and practicing photographing the many birds that migrate through New York City. On top of birdwatching, I am 
                        an avid cyclist. If possible, I'd rather ride my bike to a destination than walk, drive or take public transit. I ride for convenience, transportation and pleasure.
